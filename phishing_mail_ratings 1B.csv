* Requests sensitive information (beneficiary details) without providing clear context or justification
* Includes a vague reference to ""regulatory requirements"" without specifying what those requirements are

* The use of ambiguous language that could lead to confusion or mistrust
* The request for sensitive information without clear context or justification
* The vague reference to ""regulatory requirements"" without specifying what those requirements are
* The generic tone and language used throughout the email
